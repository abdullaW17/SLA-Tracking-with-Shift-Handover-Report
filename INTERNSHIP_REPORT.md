## Week 1 — Foundation & Core Architecture

### 📅 Focus: Project Setup, Database Design & Models

### What We Did

1. **Project Initialization & Environment Setup**
   - Created the Flask application factory pattern (`app.py`) with `create_app()` function
   - Set up `config.py` with environment-driven configuration (`DevelopmentConfig`, `ProductionConfig`, `TestingConfig`)
   - Created `extensions.py` to hold shared Flask extension instances (db, login_manager, migrate, csrf, scheduler) to avoid circular imports
   - Set up `.env` / `.env.example` for environment variables
   - Created `requirements.txt` with all dependencies

2. **Database Models Designed & Implemented (8 models)**

   | Model | File | Purpose |
   |-------|------|---------|
   | `Client` | `models/client.py` | Multi-tenant organization model with per-client timezone support |
   | `User` | `models/user.py` | User authentication with RBAC (Admin, Manager, Viewer roles) |
   | `Ticket` | `models/ticket.py` | Generic normalized ticket model with SLA computed fields |
   | `SLARule` | `models/sla_rule.py` | Database-driven SLA rule definitions (field_name/field_value matching) |
   | `FieldMapping` | `models/field_mapping.py` | Source-field → local-field translation layer |
   | `Report` | `models/report.py` | Tracks generated PDF/Excel report files |
   | `Setting` | `models/setting.py` | Key/value runtime settings table |
   | `SyncLog` | `models/sync_log.py` | Records each IRIS sync run for debugging |

3. **Multi-Tenancy Architecture (Gap #1)**
   - Every ticket, SLA rule, and field mapping is scoped to a `Client` via `client_id`
   - Clients carry their own timezone (IANA tz name) for business-hours calculations
   - IRIS tickets are routed to clients by matching `case_customer_id` → `Client.iris_customer_id`

4. **Authentication & RBAC System**
   - Flask-Login integration with hashed passwords (Werkzeug)
   - 3 roles: Admin (full access), Manager (dashboard + tickets + reports), Viewer (read-only)
   - Centralized permission matrix in `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` dict
   - `@role_required()` and `@permission_required()` decorators created in `routes/decorators.py`

5. **Seed Data Script (`seed_data.py`)**
   - Seeds 3 demo clients (Acme Corp, Globex Industries, Initech) with different timezones
   - Creates 3 demo users (admin, manager, viewer) with hashed passwords
   - Seeds SLA rules across 3 different taxonomies (severity-based, priority-based, criticality-based)
   - Creates 11 dummy tickets exercising every SLA status

### Challenges Faced

| Challenge | How We Solved It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Circular imports** between models, routes, and services | Created `extensions.py` as a shared module; imported models only inside `create_app()` after `db.init_app()` |
| **Designing a generic ticket model** that works with any taxonomy (severity, priority, criticality) | Made all taxonomy fields optional (nullable). The SLA engine uses `getattr(ticket, rule.field_name)` instead of hardcoded fields |
| **Multi-tenancy scoping** — ensuring data from different clients never collides | Added `client_id` foreign key on tickets, SLA rules, and field mappings; composite unique constraints prevent duplicates |
| **Understanding Flask-Login vs custom `is_active`** | Mapped `is_active_user` column to Flask-Login's expected `is_active` property via a `@property` decorator |

### Improvements Made
- Learned the **Application Factory Pattern** — why `create_app()` is better than a global `app` object (testability, multiple configs)
- Understood **database normalization** and why separating clients, tickets, and SLA rules into distinct tables with foreign keys is important
- Learned how to use **Flask-Migrate** for database schema migrations

## Week 2 — DFIR-IRIS Integration & SLA Engine

### 📅 Focus: API Integration, Field Mapping, SLA Calculator & Sync Pipeline

### What We Did

1. **DFIR-IRIS REST API Integration (`services/iris_api_service.py`)**
   - Built a thin wrapper around the IRIS API using `requests` library directly (no heavy SDK dependency)
   - Implemented functions: `test_connection()`, `fetch_cases()`, `fetch_alerts()`, `fetch_case_by_id()`, `fetch_all_cases()`, `fetch_all_alerts()`
   - **Pagination (Gap #6):** Uses IRIS response envelope fields (`total`, `last_page`, `current_page`) to loop until all pages are consumed, with fallback heuristic for older IRIS versions
   - **Retry with Exponential Backoff (Gap #7):** `_request_with_retry()` retries up to 3 times on transient failures (timeouts, 429, 5xx errors) with configurable backoff

2. **Field Mapping Service (`services/field_mapping_service.py`)**
   - Built the **translation layer** that makes the system source-agnostic
   - `normalize_ticket()` converts raw IRIS JSON into our generic ticket dict using configurable field mappings from the database
   - Supports **nested JSON paths** (e.g., `owner.username`) via `_get_nested()` helper
   - **Multi-tenant mapping resolution:** client-specific mappings override global defaults
   - Robust datetime parsing (`_parse_datetime()`) handles ISO8601, various formats, and forces naive datetimes to UTC (Gap #5)
   - Default IRIS field mappings can be seeded via `seed_default_iris_mappings()`

3. **Generic SLA Rule Engine (`services/sla_calculator.py`)** — 367 lines, the heart of the system
   - **Rule Matching (`find_matching_sla_rule()`):**
     - Filters by `client_id` (Gap #1: multi-tenancy)
     - Orders by `priority ASC, id ASC` (Gap #2: explicit evaluation order, first match wins)
     - Generic matching: `getattr(ticket, rule.field_name) == rule.field_value`
     - Case-insensitive, whitespace-tolerant comparison
   - **Deadline Calculation (`calculate_deadlines()`):**
     - Supports both wall-clock time and business-hours-only mode (Gap #3)
     - Accounts for accumulated `total_paused_minutes` by shifting deadlines forward (Gap #4)
   - **SLA Status Determination (`calculate_sla_status()`):**
     - No Matching Rule → "No Matching Rule"
     - Closed before deadline → "Closed Within SLA"
     - Closed after deadline → "Closed After Breach"
     - Open & now > deadline → "Breached"
     - Open & usage% ≥ warning_threshold → "Near Breach"
     - Otherwise → "Within SLA"
   - **Pause/Resume (Gap #4):** `_handle_pause_resume()` implements deadline-shift semantics — when a ticket enters a pause status, `paused_at` is set; when it leaves, elapsed time is accumulated and deadlines shift forward
   - `recalculate_all_open_tickets()` — batch recalculation for all non-closed tickets

4. **Business Hours Calculator (`services/business_hours.py`)**
   - `add_business_minutes()` computes deadlines counting only working hours (Mon-Fri 09:00-17:00)
   - Respects per-client timezone (converts to client's local timezone for calendar math, then back to UTC for storage)
   - Properly handles: weekends, before/after business hours, spanning multiple days

5. **Sync Service (`services/sync_service.py`)** — The orchestrator
   - Runs a full sync cycle: Fetch → Resolve Client → Normalize → Upsert → Calculate SLA → Soft-delete → Log
   - **Client resolution** via `case_customer_id` mapping
   - **Explicit upsert logic (Gap #8):** checks if ticket exists by composite key (`client_id`, `source_system`, `external_id`), then creates or updates
   - **Soft-delete (Gap #8):** tickets missing from the latest IRIS response are marked `status = 'deleted_in_source'` (preserves historical SLA data)
   - **Reopened ticket detection (Gap #10):** if a previously-closed ticket no longer has `closed_at`, clears SLA status to force re-evaluation
   - Records every sync run in `SyncLog` with counts (fetched, created, updated, skipped)

### Challenges Faced

| Challenge | How We Solved It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **No hardcoded severity values** — how to match SLA rules generically | Used `getattr(ticket, rule.field_name)` for dynamic attribute access + case-insensitive string comparison |
| **IRIS API response format varies** between versions | Used `.get()` with fallbacks, optional pagination envelope, and graceful degradation |
| **Business hours spanning weekends** — the deadline calculation was incorrect initially | Built a step-by-step loop that skips non-working days and hours, consuming minutes only during work windows |
| **Naive vs aware datetimes** causing comparison errors | Created `_as_aware()` helper that forces all naive datetimes to UTC; established a **timezone policy** (Gap #5) |
| **Pause/resume tracking** — how to shift deadlines without losing history | Used `paused_at` timestamp + `total_paused_minutes` accumulator; shift deadlines forward on unpause |
| **Deleted tickets in IRIS** — should we hard-delete or preserve history? | Chose **soft-delete** (`status = 'deleted_in_source'`) to preserve historical SLA metrics |

### Improvements Made
- Deeply understood **REST API integration patterns** (retry, backoff, pagination, error handling)
- Learned the importance of **separation of concerns** — API fetching, field mapping, SLA logic, and sync orchestration are all separate services
- Understood **idempotent upsert patterns** — why composite unique constraints matter for sync reliability
- Learned about **timezone-aware programming** — storing everything in UTC, converting only for display

## Week 3 — Dashboard, Reports & Automation

### 📅 Focus: UI/UX, Visualizations, Report Generation, Scheduler & Email

### What We Did

1. **Dashboard with Chart.js Visualizations (`routes/dashboard_routes.py` + `templates/dashboard.html`)**
   - Built comprehensive metrics computation: total tickets, open/closed, SLA compliance %, average resolution time
   - **5 Chart.js visualizations:**
     - SLA Status Distribution (doughnut chart)
     - Severity/Priority/Criticality Breakdown (bar chart)
     - Breach Rate metrics
     - Monthly SLA Trend (line chart — within vs breached per month)
     - Analyst Performance (per-assignee stats)
   - Multi-tenant filtering: client_id query parameter filters all metrics to a specific client
   - JSON endpoint (`/dashboard/metrics.json`) for dynamic chart refresh via `fetch()`

2. **Ticket Management UI (`routes/ticket_routes.py` + `templates/tickets.html`, `ticket_detail.html`)**
   - Ticket list with search (by title, external ID), multi-field filters (status, severity, SLA status, client)
   - Color-coded SLA badges (green = Within SLA, yellow = Near Breach, red = Breached, gray = No Rule)
   - Ticket detail view showing all fields, matched SLA rule, deadline, breach duration
   - "Sync from IRIS" button for manual sync trigger
   - "Recalculate SLA" button for manual recalculation

3. **SLA Rules CRUD (`routes/sla_rule_routes.py` + `templates/sla_rules.html`, `sla_rule_form.html`)**
   - Admin-only rule management UI (create, edit, delete, activate/deactivate)
   - Form with all rule fields: name, field_name, field_value, response SLA, resolution SLA, warning threshold, business hours flag, stop/pause/applies-to statuses, evaluation priority

4. **Report Generation (`services/report_generator.py` + `routes/report_routes.py`)**
   - **4 report types:**
     1. SLA Summary Report — high-level compliance statistics
     2. Detailed Ticket SLA Report — full ticket-by-ticket breakdown
     3. Breached Tickets Report — only breached/closed-after-breach tickets
     4. Analyst Performance Report — per-assignee SLA compliance stats
   - **2 output formats:**
     - PDF (ReportLab) — styled tables with color headers, alternating row backgrounds
     - Excel (Pandas + OpenPyXL) — multi-sheet workbooks with Summary + Detail sheets
   - Reports are tracked in the `reports` table and downloadable from the Reports page

5. **Settings UI (`routes/settings_routes.py` + `templates/settings.html`)**
   - Admin-only settings page with:
     - IRIS connection configuration + "Test Connection" button
     - Field mapping management (view, add, edit, delete mappings)
     - Client management (view clients with their IRIS customer IDs and timezones)
     - Sync log viewer (history of all sync runs with status, counts)

6. **APScheduler Background Jobs (`services/scheduler_service.py`)**
   - **Periodic IRIS sync job:** runs every `SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 15 min), fetches → normalizes → upserts → recalculates SLA → sends breach alerts if enabled
   - **Optional daily report job:** cron-triggered at `DAILY_REPORT_HOUR`, generates SLA Summary PDF + optional email
   - **Weekly report cleanup job (Gap #11):** runs every Sunday at 03:00, deletes reports older than 90 days from disk and DB

7. **Email Notifications (`services/email_service.py`)**
   - SMTP-based notification system (disabled by default)
   - **Near-breach/breach alert:** consolidated email after each sync listing all breached + near-breach tickets
   - **Daily SLA summary email:** total tickets, breached count, near-breach count
   - Recipients: all Admin and Manager users with email addresses

8. **Report Cleanup Service (`services/cleanup_service.py`)**
   - 90-day retention policy for generated reports
   - Deletes both the file on disk and the DB record
   - Handles OS errors gracefully (logs warnings, continues with other files)

9. **Base Template & Styling (`templates/base.html` + `static/css/style.css`)**
   - Bootstrap 5 responsive layout with navigation sidebar
   - Consistent styling across all pages
   - Jinja2 `context_processor` injects `sla_badge_color` helper for template-wide SLA badge coloring

### Challenges Faced

| Challenge | How We Solved It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Chart.js data format** — getting the right shape for doughnut/bar/line charts | Created a dedicated `metrics_json()` endpoint that pre-computes all chart data server-side and returns clean JSON |
| **APScheduler running in Flask** — app context issues | Wrapped every job function with `with app.app_context():` since APScheduler jobs run outside Flask request context |
| **Scheduler starting twice** in debug mode (Werkzeug reloader) | Guarded `init_scheduler()` with `if scheduler.running: return` and used `use_reloader=False` |
| **PDF table layout** with many columns overflowing the page | Used `landscape(A4)` page size, reduced font size to 7.5pt, and capped rows at 500 per PDF for sane file sizes |
| **Report cleanup** — file deletion vs DB record deletion | Delete the file first (with error handling), then always delete the DB record to prevent orphan records |

### Improvements Made
- Learned **Chart.js integration** with Flask — how to pass server data to client-side JavaScript charts
- Understood the **challenges of background job scheduling** in web applications (app context, thread safety, duplicate execution)
- Learned **PDF generation with ReportLab** — document templates, table styles, paragraph styles
- Understood **report lifecycle management** — generation, storage, download, and cleanup

## Week 4 — Security Hardening, Testing & Polish

### 📅 Focus: Security, Testing, Error Handling & Documentation

### What We Did

1. **Security Hardening (Gap #9)**
   - **CSRF Protection:** Flask-WTF `CSRFProtect` initialized globally, protecting all POST forms
   - **Session Cookie Hardening:** `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE="Lax"`, `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME=8 hours`
   - **Login Rate Limiting:** in-memory lockout after 5 failed attempts in 15 minutes per username
     - `_is_locked_out()`, `_record_failed_attempt()`, `_clean_old_attempts()`, `_clear_attempts()` in `auth_routes.py`
     - All lockouts are logged with `logger.warning()`
   - **Password Hashing:** Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash` / `check_password_hash` (bcrypt-like)
   - **API Key handling:** IRIS API key stays in `.env` only (never in DB Settings table)

2. **Test Suite (`tests/`)**
   - **Test Configuration (`tests/conftest.py`):**
     - Flask app with `TestingConfig` (in-memory SQLite, CSRF disabled)
     - Auto-cleanup: `db.create_all()` before each test, `db.drop_all()` after
     - Fixtures: `sample_client`, `sample_clients` (multi-tenant), `sample_rules` (cross-client rules)
   - **SLA Calculator Tests (`tests/test_sla_calculator.py`):**
     - Tests rule matching (correct rule found by field_name/field_value)
     - Tests multi-tenant isolation (same field_value, different clients get different rules)
     - Tests priority ordering (lower priority number wins)
     - Tests deadline calculation (wall-clock and business-hours modes)
     - Tests SLA status transitions (Within → Near Breach → Breached → Closed)
     - Tests pause/resume semantics (deadline shifts forward on unpause)
     - Tests edge cases (no matching rule, no created_at, closed tickets)
   - **Sync Service Tests (`tests/test_sync_service.py`):**
     - Tests upsert logic (create new ticket, update existing)
     - Tests soft-delete behavior (tickets missing from IRIS marked as `deleted_in_source`)
     - Tests reopened ticket detection (closed_at cleared → SLA re-evaluated)
     - Tests client resolution from raw case data

3. **Error Handling & Robustness**
   - Sync service catches per-ticket errors without failing the entire sync batch
   - Scheduler wraps each job in try/except with `logger.exception()` — one failed job doesn't crash others
   - `_request_with_retry()` has configurable max retries, backoff multiplier, and retryable status codes
   - `cleanup_old_reports()` handles individual file deletion failures gracefully

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive `README.md` (217 lines) covering:
     - Feature list, project structure, setup steps, demo logins
     - IRIS connection guide, SLA rules configuration guide
     - PostgreSQL migration instructions
     - Scheduler management, report generation guide
     - Future development notes (intern handoff section)
     - Known limitations
   - Inline docstrings on every module, class, and function explaining design decisions
   - "Gap #N" comments throughout code referencing specific design improvements

5. **Utility Scripts**
   - `seed_data.py` — comprehensive database seeder (clients, users, mappings, rules, tickets)
   - `clear_seed_data.py` — clears all seeded data for fresh start
   - `fix_field_mappings.py` — utility to repair/update field mappings

### Challenges Faced

| Challenge | How We Solved It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **CSRF tokens breaking AJAX requests** | Used Flask-WTF's CSRF token injection in forms; for AJAX, passed token in headers |
| **In-memory rate limiter resets on restart** | Documented as a known limitation; acceptable for MVP since a proper solution (Redis/DB-backed) is a production enhancement |
| **Testing with SQLAlchemy sessions** — objects detaching from session between fixtures | Used `db.session.refresh()` + `db.session.expunge()` in fixtures to detach clean objects |
| **Testing the sync service** requires mocking IRIS API calls | Used `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `iris_api_service` functions in tests |
| **Timezone-aware datetime comparisons** in tests | Consistently used `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` and the `now` fixture for reproducible test times |

### Improvements Made
- Learned **web application security fundamentals** — CSRF, session cookies, rate limiting, password hashing
- Understood **test-driven development** with pytest — fixtures, mocking, isolation
- Learned the importance of **documentation** for code handoff — every module has a docstring explaining "why" not just "what"
- Understood the difference between **MVP security** and production-grade security (in-memory vs Redis-backed rate limiting)

### Step-by-Step Data Flow

#### 1️⃣ User Authentication
```
User → /login (POST username/password)
  → auth_routes.py checks rate limit (_is_locked_out)
  → User.query.filter_by(username=...) fetches from DB
  → user.check_password() verifies bcrypt hash
  → login_user(user) creates session
  → Redirect to /dashboard
```

#### 2️⃣ IRIS Data Sync (Automatic or Manual)

```

#### 4️⃣ Dashboard Rendering
```
User → /dashboard?client_id=1

  → dashboard_routes._build_dashboard_metrics(client_id)
    ├─ Query all tickets (filtered by client if specified)
    ├─ Count: total, open, closed, within_sla, near_breach, breached
    ├─ Calculate: SLA compliance %, avg resolution time
    ├─ Compute: analyst stats, taxonomy distribution, monthly trend
    └─ Return metrics dict

  → render_template("dashboard.html", metrics=...)
    └─ Chart.js renders 5 visualizations from metrics data
       + JSON endpoint (/dashboard/metrics.json) for dynamic refresh
```

#### 5️⃣ Report Generation
```
User → /reports (POST report_type="SLA Summary Report", format="pdf")

  → report_routes generates report
    └─ report_generator.generate_report(app, type, format, user_id)
       ├─ Query tickets (filtered by type - e.g., only breached)
       ├─ Compute summary stats
       │
       ├─ IF format == "xlsx":
       │   └─ pandas.ExcelWriter → Summary sheet + Detail sheet
       │
       └─ IF format == "pdf":
           └─ ReportLab SimpleDocTemplate
              ├─ Title + timestamp
              ├─ Summary stats table
              └─ Detail table (color-coded headers, alternating rows)
       
       → Save file to generated_reports/
       → Create Report DB record
       → Return report for download
```

#### 6️⃣ Background Scheduler Loop
```
APScheduler (runs continuously in background)

Every {SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES} minutes:
  ├─ sync_cases_from_iris()              ← Full sync cycle
  ├─ recalculate_all_open_tickets()       ← Update SLA for all open tickets
  └─ send_breach_alerts_if_needed()       ← Email if breaches detected

Daily at {DAILY_REPORT_HOUR}:00 (if enabled):
  ├─ generate_report("SLA Summary", "pdf") ← Auto-generate daily report
  └─ send_daily_summary_email()            ← Email summary to admins/managers

Every Sunday at 03:00:
  └─ cleanup_old_reports(max_age_days=90)  ← Delete old reports from disk + DB

## 🏆 Summary of Achievements

### By The Numbers

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Python source files | **30+** |
| Total lines of code | **~4,000+** |
| Database models | **8** |
| Service modules | **9** |
| Route Blueprints | **6** |
| HTML templates | **10** |
| Report types | **4** (PDF + Excel) |
| Test files | **3** (conftest + 2 test modules) |
| Identified & closed design gaps | **11** |

### Design Gaps Addressed

| Gap # | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Gap #1 | Multi-tenancy | `client_id` on tickets, rules, mappings; client-scoped queries |
| Gap #2 | SLA rule priority/ordering | `priority` column with ASC ordering, first-match-wins |
| Gap #3 | Business hours SLA | `add_business_minutes()` with Mon-Fri 09:00-17:00 + client timezone |
| Gap #4 | Pause/resume tracking | `paused_at` + `total_paused_minutes` with deadline-shift semantics |
| Gap #5 | Timezone handling | All-UTC storage, `_as_aware()` helper, `_parse_datetime()` forces UTC |
| Gap #6 | API pagination | Envelope-aware pagination loop with fallback heuristic |
| Gap #7 | API retry/backoff | `_request_with_retry()` — 3 retries, exponential backoff, retryable status codes |
| Gap #8 | Sync upsert + soft-delete | Composite key upsert + `status='deleted_in_source'` for missing tickets |
| Gap #9 | Security hardening | CSRF, session cookies, login rate limiting, password hashing |
| Gap #10 | Reopened ticket detection | Clear `closed_at` + force SLA re-evaluation on reopen |
| Gap #11 | Report cleanup | 90-day retention policy with weekly cron job |

### Key Design Principles

1. **Zero hardcoded severity/priority values** — SLA rules are purely data-driven (`field_name`/`field_value` matching)
2. **Source-agnostic architecture** — field mapping layer means switching from IRIS to another platform requires only mapping row changes
3. **Multi-tenant by design** — every data record is scoped to a client; cross-client contamination is impossible
4. **Separation of concerns** — API fetching, normalization, SLA logic, sync orchestration, and reporting are all isolated services
5. **Defensive coding** — graceful error handling at every layer; one bad ticket doesn't crash the entire sync
