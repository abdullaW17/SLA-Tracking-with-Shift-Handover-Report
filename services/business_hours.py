services/business_hours.py
----------------------------
Business-hours-aware SLA deadline calculation (Gap #3).

Provides ``add_business_minutes(start_dt, minutes, client)`` which returns
a deadline datetime that only counts working hours.

Default schedule: Monday-Friday 09:00-17:00 in the client's timezone.
The schedule is intentionally kept simple for the MVP — a per-client
``BusinessCalendar`` model can be added later to support holidays, custom
hours, etc.
